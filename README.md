> Professional Python project for Web Mining and Applied NLP.

Web Mining and Applied NLP focus on retrieving, processing, and analyzing text from the web and other digital sources.
This course builds those capabilities through working projects.

In the age of generative AI, durable skills are grounded in real work:
setting up a professional environment,
reading and running code,
understanding the logic,
and pushing work to a shared repository.
Each project follows a similar structure based on professional Python projects.
These projects are **hands-on textbooks** for learning Web Mining and Applied NLP.

## This Project

This project focuses on retrieving and processing structured text data
**from web APIs in JSON format**.

The goal is to acquire JSON data from an external source,
inspect and validate its structure,
transform it into a usable format,
and load it into a reproducible output.

You've likely heard of ETL or ELT.
We recommend EVTL.

In EVTL, each stage has a source, a process, and a sink.

- **Extract** acquires data
- **Validate** inspects and checks it
- **Transform** reshapes it
- **Load** sends it to the chosen destination

This project illustrates how to **work with real API data and understand its structure before analysis**.

## Key Files

You'll work with these files as you update authorship and experiment:

- **src/nlp/pipeline_api_json.py** - MAIN PIPELINE SCRIPT (no changes needed)
- **src/nlp/config_case.py** - Python configuration (<mark>**copy and edit**</mark> for your custom project)
- **src/nlp/stage01_extract.py** - EXTRACT (no changes needed)
- **src/nlp/stage02_validate_case.py** - VALIDATE (<mark>**copy and edit**</mark>)
- **src/nlp/stage03_transform_case.py** - TRANSFORM (<mark>**copy and edit**</mark>)
- **src/nlp/stage04_load.py** - LOAD (no changes needed)
- **pyproject.toml** - <mark>**update**</mark> authorship, links, and dependencies
- **zensical.toml** - <mark>**update**</mark> authorship and links

## First: Follow These Instructions

Follow the [step-by-step workflow guide](https://denisecase.github.io/pro-analytics-02/workflow-b-apply-example-project/) to complete:

1. Phase 1. **Start & Run**
2. Phase 2. **Change Authorship**
3. Phase 3. **Read & Understand**

## Success

After running the script successfully, you will see:


```shell
========================
Pipeline executed successfully!
========================
```

And new files will appear:

- project.log - confirming successful run
- data/raw/case_raw.json - dump of the fetched JSON
- data/processed/case_processed.csv - final loaded result

## Command Reference

The commands below are used in the workflow guide above.
They are provided here for convenience.

Follow the guide for the **full instructions**.

### In a machine terminal (open in your `Repos` folder)

After you get a copy of this repo in your own GitHub account,
open a machine terminal in your `Repos` folder:

```shell
# Replace username with YOUR GitHub username.
git clone https://github.com/username/nlp-04-api-text-data
cd nlp-04-api-text-data
code .
```

### In a VS Code terminal

```shell
uv self update
uv python pin 3.14
uv sync --extra dev --extra docs --upgrade

uvx pre-commit install
git add -A
uvx pre-commit run --all-files

# repeat if changes were made
git add -A
uvx pre-commit run --all-files

# Later, we install spacy data model and
# en_core_web_sm = english, core, web, small
# It's big: spacy+data ~200+ MB w/ model installed
#           ~350–450 MB for .venv is normal for NLP
# uv run python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm

# First, run the module
# IMPORTANT: Close each figure after viewing so execution continues
uv run python -m nlp.pipeline_api_json

uv run ruff format .
uv run ruff check . --fix
uv run zensical build

git add -A
git commit -m "update"
git push -u origin main
```

</details>

## Notes

- Use the **UP ARROW** and **DOWN ARROW** in the terminal to scroll through past commands.
- Use `CTRL+f` to find (and replace) text within a file.

## Enhancements

In production systems, validation is often automated using tools
such as Great Expectations or Soda.

In this module, validation is implemented manually to develop a
clear understanding of structure, assumptions, and data quality.
